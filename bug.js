```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  // ... more configurations ...
};
```
This configuration is missing the path to your component files.  Tailwind needs to know where to look for the classes you are using in your components to generate the correct CSS.

The problem is that Tailwind cannot find the classes you're using in your components unless they are correctly included in the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file. If you add a new component file, you need to update this array.
